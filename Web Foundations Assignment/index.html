        <p>
            Hello, I'm Adarsh Pathange, and I'm thrilled to have you in my class! Hailing from the vibrant city of Bangalore, India, I bring close to 3.5 years of extensive experience in Database Administration and Azure Cloud.

            My professional journey led me to manage the infrastructure divisions of some of the world's leading tech giants, all of which are Fortune 500 companies. Working with cutting-edge technology and ensuring the seamless functioning of critical server systems has been my passion and expertise.

            Beyond the world of technology, I'm an avid outdoor enthusiast. You can often find me on hiking trails, or enjoying a refreshing swim. I thrive on outdoor adventures and believe in the power of collaboration. Feel free to reach out, and together, we'll explore the fascinating realms of technology and the great outdoors.
